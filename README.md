## Python is a multi-paradigm language. 
This means it can do both OOP and functional programming.
In here I show case how one can achieve functional programming in py.

## Built-in Functions
Python has many built-in functions that follow the functional programming paradigm. Some examples include map(), filter(), reduce() e.t.c.

## Higher-order Functions
These are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as results. Python supports higher-order functions through the use of lambda expressions and function objects.

## Lambda Expressions
These are anonymous functions that can be defined and used on the fly. They are often used as arguments to higher-order functions.

## Function Decorators
These are higher-order functions that take a function as an argument and return a new function with additional functionality. Decorators are a powerful tool for adding functionality to existing functions without modifying their code.

## Functional Data Structures
Python's built-in data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries can be used in a functional way. For example, you can use list comprehensions to create new lists based on existing lists, without modifying the original list.

## Functional Programming Libraries
There are several libraries available that provide additional functional programming features in Python. Some popular ones include toolz, fn.py, and CyToolz.

## Pure Functions
These are functions that always return the same output for the same input, and have no side effects. Writing pure functions is a key principle of functional programming.

## Immutability
In functional programming, data is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed once it's created. While Python doesn't enforce immutability, you can choose to use immutable data structures like tuples and avoid modifying variables once they've been assigned.

## Recursion 
This is a programming technique where a function calls itself. Recursion is often used in functional programming as an alternative to loops.
